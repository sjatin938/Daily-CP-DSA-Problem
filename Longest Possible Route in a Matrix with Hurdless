Longest Possible Route in a Matrix with Hurdles

Given an M x N matrix, with a few hurdles arbitrarily placed, calculate the length of the longest possible route possible from source to a destination within the matrix. We are allowed to move to only adjacent cells which are not hurdles. The route cannot contain any diagonal moves and a location once visited in a particular path cannot be visited again.
For example, the longest path with no hurdles from source to destination is highlighted below. The length of the path is 24.
 
 
                      { { 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 },
                      { 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1 },
                      { 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 } };
